# Chatter Firmware

> The repository for the core firmware that comes preloaded on every Chatter.


Put together and code two encrypted wireless communicators.

# Compiling

The firmware is based on the [Chatter Library](https://github.com/CircuitMess/Chatter-Library).

The library is included with other device libraries in the CircuitMess ESP32 Arduino platform.

More info and installation instructions
on [CircuitMess/Arduino-Packages](https://github.com/CircuitMess/Arduino-Packages).

## Using Arduino IDE

### Installing the package

Follow the package installation
instructions [here](https://github.com/CircuitMess/Arduino-Packages?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### Building

Open Chatter-Firmware.ino using Arduino IDE, set the board to Chatter, and compile.

## Using CMake

To compile and upload, you need to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
and [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) installed. You also need to have both of
them registered in the PATH.

In the CMakeLists.txt file, change the port to your desired COM port (default is /dev/ttyUSB0):

```
set(PORT /dev/ttyUSB0)
```

Then in the root directory of the repository type:

```
mkdir cmake
cd cmake
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target CMBuild
```

This will compile the binaries and place the .bin and .elf files in the build/ directory located in
the root of the repository.

To compile the binary and upload it according to the port set in CMakeLists.txt, run

```
cmake --build . --target CMBuild
```

in the cmake directory.

# Uploading SPIFFS

The ESP32 contains a Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System (SPIFFS). SPIFFS is a
lightweight filesystem created for microcontrollers with a flash chip.

Here are stored UI and audio assets used in the firmware.

## Using the Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader plugin (only for Arduino 1.X)

Install the [plugin](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) following the instructions
from
the [README.md](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

Then from the opened sketch select Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload menu item. This should start
uploading the files into ESP32 flash filesystem.

## Using the mkspiffs utility

When building with CMake or Arduino 2.X, you will need to build and upload the SPIFFS image
separately.

First, download the latest [mkspiffs](https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs) utility for your OS with
the "-arduino-esp32" suffix. (For
example, [mkspiffs-0.2.3-arduino-esp32-win32.zip](https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs/releases/download/0.2.3/mkspiffs-0.2.3-arduino-esp32-win32.zip)
for Windows).

Then create the binary SPIFFS image using the command in the root of the project:

```
mkspiffs -c data -s 0x1EF000 -b 4096 -p 256 spiffs.bin
```

The block size (-b) and page size (-p) parameters should stay as-is.

The size parameter (-s) can be determined from the board-specific SPIFFS partition size, which
can be found in the
platform [boards.txt](https://github.com/CircuitMess/Arduino-ESP32/blob/master/boards.txt) under
`<device>.menu.PartitionScheme.min_spiffs.upload.maximum_size`

For uploading the image, you will need to download [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

Then, flash the compiled image to the board.

The SPIFFS partition address will be defined alongside the SPIFFS partitions size, under
`<device>.menu.PartitionScheme.min_spiffs.upload.spiffs_start`.
This parameter is used in the
following esptool command call (before referencing the built image):

```
esptool --chip esp32 --baud 921600  --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0x211000 spiffs.bin
```

# Restoring the stock firmware

There are three main ways to restore the stock firmware:

### 1) Restoring using esptool

For uploading the firmware this way, you will need to
download [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).

Then download the prebuilt binary on
the [releases page](https://github.com/CircuitMess/Chatter-Firmware/releases) of this repository
and flash it manually using esptool:

```shell
esptool write_flash 0x0 Codee-Firmware.bin
```

### 2) Restoring using Arduino's burn bootloader option

This Arduino option is usually reserved for bootloader flashing.

For devices included in the CircuitMess ESP32 Arduino platform this will actually restore the
firmware.

Open this project in Arduino and select your board in the `Tools > Board` dropdown menu.

Then select the appropriate firmware under `Tools > Programmer` and click the `Tools > Burn 
bootloader` option.

### 3) Restoring using CircuitBlocks

[CircuitBlocks](https://code.circuitmess.com/) is our educational block-based coding platform.

You can also restore your firmware here by logging in, clicking the "Restore Firmware" button in the top-right corner,
and following the on-screen instructions.
